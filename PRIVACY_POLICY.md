# Privacy Policy for Chrome Extension Template

**Effective Date:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}

Thank you for using Chrome Extension Template (the "Extension"), provided by Example Company ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Extension.

**By installing or using the Extension, you agree to how we handle things as described below.**

### What Information We Handle

1. **Anonymous Usage Analytics (via Google Analytics 4):**
   * To understand general usage patterns (like which features are used, if the enable toggle is popular, or if sharing works) and make the Extension better, we use Google Analytics.
   * **What data is sent:** We send anonymized event information like extension lifecycle events (installed, updated), page views within the extension (popup, options), changes to core settings (enable toggle), feature usage (unlocked, share attempted), and periodic rule statistics (counts of rules/bundles). We also send a randomly generated identifier and session information so Google Analytics can differentiate between usage instances and sessions. These identifiers are stored locally in your browser. We also send basic info like your browser language.
   * **How it's sent:** This data is sent securely using Google's systems directly to Google's servers via a background process within the extension.
   * **What we DON'T collect:** We **do not** collect your IP address, your browsing history, or the content of the pages you visit via Google Analytics.
   * You can learn more about how Google handles data in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

2. **Error Reporting (via Sentry):**
   * Sometimes, things break. To find and fix bugs, we use a service called Sentry.
   * **What data is sent:** If the Extension encounters an unexpected error, details about the error (like the error message, the location in the code where it happened, your browser type/version, OS, and the extension version) are automatically sent to Sentry. This helps us diagnose the problem.
   * **How it's sent:** Like analytics, this is sent securely via a background process.
   * **What we DON'T collect:** Sentry reports **do not** include your rules, your browsing history, or the content of the pages you visit. It's focused solely on the technical details of the error itself.
   * You can learn more about Sentry's privacy practices [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

### Data Storage and Security

* Your analytics identifiers and session data are stored via Chrome's local storage.
* Analytics and error data are sent directly to Google and Sentry, respectively, using secure connections. We rely on their security measures for data they receive.
* We don't operate our own servers for storing your rules or usage data.
* While we and our partners (Google, Sentry) use reasonable security measures, remember that no system is perfectly secure.

### Data Sharing (or Lack Thereof)

We don't sell or rent your information. We only share data in these limited ways:
*   **Google:** Anonymized usage data is sent to Google Analytics 4 as described above.
*   **Sentry:** Error report data is sent to Sentry as described above.
* **Business Transfers:** If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, information may be transferred as part of that deal. If this happens, the new owners may handle information in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
* **Legal Stuff:** We might have to disclose information if required by law or a valid legal request (like a court order).

### Your Choices & Control (Where Applicable)

*   You can uninstall the Extension at any time through your browser's extension management settings. Uninstalling will remove the extension and its locally stored data.
*   Standard data rights like access, rectification, and erasure under laws like GDPR/CCPA apply to data held by Google/Sentry according to their policies.

### Children's Privacy

This Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

### Changes to This Policy

We might tweak this policy occasionally. If we make significant changes, we'll update the date at the top and may notify you via the Extension or the Web Store listing. Continuing to use the Extension after changes means you're okay with the new policy.
